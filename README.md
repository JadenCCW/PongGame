Pong - Jaden Chung's First Python Game

This is my first Python Game. For now the final product is only one screen but possible updates in the future (ex. usernames, custom color paddles, difficulty).

Has Scoreboard, Borders, Sound Effects, and Title.

Used a tutorial to learn how to use turtles and winsound, but did the math, bounce calculations, scoreboard, and almost everything else by myself.

Thanks!
