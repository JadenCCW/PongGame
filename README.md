Pong - Jaden Chung's First Python Game

This is my first Python Game. For now the final product is only one screen but possible updates in the future (ex. usernames, custom color paddles, difficulty).

Has Scoreboard, Borders, Sound Effects, and Title.

Used a tutorial to learn how to use turtles, winsound, and game pieces, but did the borders, bounce calculations, scoreboard, and almost everything else by myself.

Use 'w' and 's' to move the left paddle and the up arrow and down arrow to move the right paddle.

To change the speed of the ball go to line 43 and change ball.dx and ball.dy to something else.

Thanks!
